# Plank Theme Collection

### About the collection

This is a huge Plank theme collection 107 plank themes in total and growing, they have been collected from various places around the web and integrated into one theme pack for convenience, Iâ€™ve only shown a few in the screen shots as there is to many to show in one place.

##

### How to install

To install the Plank themes, copy the contents of the Plank Themes folder to `~/.local/share/plank/themes` or to `/usr/share/plank/themes` for system-wide use. Now open the Plank preferences window by executing `plank --preferences` from a terminal and then select from the huge collection of themes.
