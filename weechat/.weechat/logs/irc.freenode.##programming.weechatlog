2017-07-20 16:57:50	+Shayanjm	we need more _really good_ programmers.
2017-07-20 16:57:55	+Shayanjm	we are seriously lacking in those.
2017-07-20 16:58:13	Rounin	Which is quite scary, seeing as programming is taking over huge chunks of eveything else
2017-07-20 16:58:17	Rounin	So if there aren't programming jobs, what jobs are there in the end
2017-07-20 16:58:30	+Shayanjm	Rounin: there are lots of programming jobs
2017-07-20 16:58:43	+Shayanjm	but it turns out that you actually have to be really good at it to qualify for them

2017-07-20 16:59:16	jimmt	I've heard a large amount of those programming job postings with a bunch of 5+ year experience requirements are just fake ones so that nobody can actually match the requirements and they can abuse the h1b program with a plausible deniability
2017-07-20 16:59:17	ocn	jimmt: did anyone ever become a programmer for money? especially with all the outsourcing going on...
2017-07-20 16:59:22	Rounin	WHat it seems like from where I'm sitting is that the jobs tend to be in specific areas... Namely a few cities in the US, and some low-cost countries that get outsourced jobs
2017-07-20 16:59:41	+Shayanjm	Rounin: or if you're really good at what you do, you can work remotely and earn lots of $$.
